The build process used in this project can largely be credited to the 11ty starting point template [deventy](https://github.com/ianrose/deventy), by Ian Rose (who has supremely good web development sensibilities).
That template provided the following technologies for me to hang my hat on.
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/)
- [Sass/SCSS](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), which mainly handles the
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), which lets me write in ES6 when I want to.
- [light-server](https://github.com/txchen/light-server), which lets me see my changes without mashing refresh.
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- [CSSnano](https://cssnano.co/)
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
