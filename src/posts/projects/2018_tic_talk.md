Tic Talk: A Time Management App

The problem was this: my roommate and I took a long time to learn time management through college and in our years of bad time management we lost sleep and we cut corners on assignments. As we got better at managing our time, so too did the quality of our lives increase. How could we, Computer Engineering students, create something for our Capstone Senior Design project, that could help others do the same?

We spent fall semester planning. With our advisor's guidance, we conducted interviews with our target audience (Engineering College Students) to elicit requirements, and worked hard to decide how to turn those requirements into features. In the end, we decided that we needed an application that would 
1. allow users to input their upcoming assignments and schedule them as desired
1. suggest how long an assignment might take based on history and user estimation
1. automatically schedule a week
1. integrate with Google Calendar
1. be cross-platform
1. be easy-to-use (to satisfy my recent UI/UX obsessions)
1. engage with the user to encourage good practices (without being an annoying Clippy)

Then, came spring semester. _Oh_ how quickly that deadline came up on us. Overwhelmed with our other classes, we had trouble dedicating the time we needed to polish this application. Frankly, we could have used our own app. But despite that, we managed to constantly adapt our plan to changing circumstances and to have a working prototype at the Senior Design Expo. And here it is:

It wasn't without bugs, but we still found things to be proud of. The Google Calendar integration had a surprising number of hurdles that were overcome. The interview process was extraordinarily insightful, and deeply developed our skills in developing requirements. We managed to meet our stakeholders' requirements with a clever paradigm that encouraged users to schedule work in reasonable blocks, ahead of time, and to still get plenty of sleep. We learned from Material Design and the Apple Human Interface Guidelines and developed an intuitive design language and interaction paradigm. And finally, the project itself managed to be one last lesson in programming Time Management.
